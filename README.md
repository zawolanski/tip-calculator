### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- initializing the Svelte application
- configuring the SCSS and `rollup-plugin-svelte-svg` to work together with the Svelte app
- writing components and passing props
- creating a writable store
- handling forms in the Svelte

### Continued development

It is my first Svelte project. I always wanted to try the Svelte but there wasn't an opportunity for that. When I finally got it, I tried it and I know that 
it was not a one-time adventure, because writing in it gave me a lot of satisfaction. I would like to improve my skills with handling forms, learn any UI library and try SvelteKit.
